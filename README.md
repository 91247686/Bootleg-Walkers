# Bootleg_Walkers
Bootleg Walkers mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead


# Features:
* - Adds eleven walkers to the game.
* - Adds a recipe book for the above ("Northrup ATSV schematics"), found very rarely where science items are found.
* - Modifies the existing Chicken Walker to be slightly tougher and faster.
* - Makes walkers leave salvageable wrecks instead of just exploding.
* - Allows friendly walkers to be deactivated, as manhacks can.
* - Allows one to very rarely find packed Chicken Walkers.


# Walkers: 

* - Shared traits: bootleg walkers have lower health, speed, armour and sight range (the only exceptions being Super Walkers), and their weaponry is prone to malfunction.

* - Unarmed Walker: The basis for all other walkers (with two exceptions (four if counting chicken walkers)).  It is armed with only a tazer.  Not intended for combat.

* - Scrap Walker: The only walker that doesn't require schematics to construct, this unit is a heavily damaged Chicken Walker, held together with duct tape and hope.  It is much weaker than even bootleg walkers, and can only carry up to 220 5.56 NATO M855A1 and 12 40mm frag rounds.

* - Bootleg Walker: Armed with a pair of 5.56 rifles, this unit is quite lethal, as long as it is supplied with sufficient ammunition.  Can carry up to 1000 5.56 NATO M855A1 rounds.

* - Buckshot Walker: Armed with a pair of automatic shotguns, this unit excels in close range combat, assuming it's kept loaded.  Can carry up to 500 00 shot.

* - Flare Walker: Most bootleg walkers have poor night vision, this unit compensates for that by firing signal flares at foes, acting as a spotter.  Can carry up to 500 signal flares.

* - Tesla Walker: Armed with two powerful Tesla coils, this unit is quite capable at supporting other units in crowd control.  However it, and other walkers, have only limited resistance to electric shocks, and will require regular maintenance.  Does not require ammunition.

* - Laser Walker: Armed with a trio of lasers, this unit is not quite as deadly as the Bootleg Walker, but does not require ammunition.

* - Fusion Walker: An immensely destructive unit, armed with a pair of fusion blasters.  Keep away from forests.  Does not require ammunition.

* - Flamer Walker: A similarly destructive unit, armed with a heavy flamethrower.  Can carry up to 10 litres of napalm.

* - Super Walker: The only bootleg walker that's actually better than the Chicken Walker.  Armed with an M2 Browning, electroshock and -magnet units alongside six mechadendrite-mounted blades. Capable of leaping short distances, outrunning all but the fastest prey and impaling targets with its blades, this unit's sheer power comes at the cost of requiring several very rare components and substantial time to construct.  Also equipped with an active defence system and integrated self-repair nanobots.  Can carry up to 1000 .50 BMG Ball rounds.

* - Unarmed Super Walker: As above, minus the M2 Browning.


# Constructing the walkers:
* - First you'll need the schematics (unless you're making a scrap walker, in which case "R"ead the broken Chicken Walker), then it's a matter of accruing the resources needed to construct a Walker Chassis, and after that, an Unarmed Walker. Then decide which flavour of death you wish to rain upon your enemies, and construct the finished walker.
